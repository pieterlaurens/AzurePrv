1. Deploy entis VM from Powershell
2. Add inbound rules
3. Join VM to entis domain (to log in with @entis.ai) --> Karel
4. Copy project datamart .bak file from nlams00872, restore on VM
5. Login as entisadmin (for integrated security) 
6. Open SSMS and Create SSIS catalog. Add PRV-dev folder.
7. Install Azure storage tools and storage explorer (to download .bak files for data handler)
8. Copy relevant bak files to temporary storage
9. Restore bak files on local server
10. Replace the references (Microsoft.SqlServer.ManagedDTS and Microsoft.SqlServer.ScriptTask) in the PipelineFramework for the SQL Server 140 version (14.0). [C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Enterprise\Common7\IDE\PublicAssemblies\]
11. Build the pipeline framework with Administrator rights so the resulting DLL is added to the local GAC.
12. Copy the DLLs to the VM and run gacutil there (v8.1a, x64) to install Newtonsoft 7.01 net45 and (new) PipelineFramework
13. Copy the PrvAnalytics folder from nlams00872 to the F drive of the VM (it needs to have the /Release folder filled).
14. Update CreatePrepareEnvironment to have the if-then-else rules point to the correct drie/folder for the dacpac files (F:\PrvAnalytics)
15. Rebuild the PlatformHandlers and PlatformComponents (SSIS projects) with the new PipelineFramework in the GAC.
16. Copy the resulting .ispac files from bin directory in TFS to D: drive on VM.
17. Run (modified) powershell script to install SSIS packages with isdeploymentwizard.
